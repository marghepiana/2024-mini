Exercise 3: 
In this exercise we created a game with our pico rasberry py and then we used firebase to upload the player's results. Every time the LED flashed the user had to press the button. We computed the average, minimum and maximum response time of the user for 10 flashes. We stored the result in a dictionary and we wrote them on a json file. Once we palyed the game and made sure everything was working we added the necessary lines to our code to uplaod the results to Firebase. To do so on our gmail email we made a firebase account and created a new project with a live database. We then connected our rasberry pi to the wifi, we then ran the code ans saw the results being uploaded in the live database
